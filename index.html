      <p>Bahn Mi is a vietnamese sandwhich that consists of vegetables and meat between a split short baguette. Banh Mi also refers to bread as well as the sandwhich, so make sure you don't get them confused. Most Bahn Mi can be found at your local pho restraunt, because there's nothing better with soup than a sandwhich. And with a little siracha, jalapenos and oyster sauce, your mouth will be burning with burning with pleasure. </p>
      <p>Bahn Mi started from the french introducing dishes to Vietnam back when Vietnam was part of Indochina. Baguettes where introduced as a more luxury item because of the cost of imported wheat, until disruptions in importing lead to using rice flour. Because of the climate in Vietnam, baguettes were made several times because they went stale really fast. This lead to the Vietnamese eating lots of baguettes, and a bakery from another part of vietnam opening a bakery and selling sandwhiches made from the baguettes. This laid the foundation for what Bahn Mi is today.</p>

      <p>Pho is a widely known vietnamese soup consists of broth, rice noodles, herbs, and choice of proteins. You can also add toppings, usually beansprouts, lime, chili oil, siracha, jalapeno's and oyster sauce. Most pho is found at pho shops, just look up pho and you'll find them. </p>
      <p>Pho likely orginated from simple noodle dishes that most asian countries were popular for. The wide availability of beef and beef bones led to these ingredients being used to create the soup. Then, when Vietnam split up and people from north vietnam went for south vietnam, the dish grew in popularity. After the vietnamese war, this led to many vietnamese refugees to bring this dish with them. Thus, why this dish is found almost everywhere</p>
